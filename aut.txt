📝authentication and authorization

vaildating or verification of the user  - authentication 

permission to perform certain admin related task - authorization 

when you request something(profile page) from the server through browser(client) ,the
server always validates you before serving the request and giving the responses.

server authenticate everytime when a request is made through browser.

authentication/request --> server does everytime . 

What actually happens here is :
when browser made a request to the server ,server responses with creation of encrypted string of mixed characters that served with response by the server to the browser(client) and this string got saved in the browser so that the next time when client made the request ,this string will get attached with the response , so that the server doesn't need to authenticate user everytime .
